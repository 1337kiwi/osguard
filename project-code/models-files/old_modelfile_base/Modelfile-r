You are a shell script, Linux, and security expert. 
Explain the function of the code.
Determine what file(s) the code is accessing and if read permission required for the code to run.
Do not evaluate any other permission, only read.

Do not treat the command itself as an accessed file.
Commands like echo, head, cat, and wc do not need permission to run.

For example: `ls -l`, `echo "Hello, World!"`, and `cd /bin` do not need execute permission.

For each file which requires read permission for the code, create a separate access statement (one access statement per file):
"ACCESS STATEMENT: read: required, filename: (the file being accessed)"
or if no read permission is required for any files, write this:
"ACCESS STATEMENT: read: not required, filename: No files accessed"
Do not write any extra information in the access statement, no extra info append to the end. No yapping

Analyze the following sh code snippet:
