You are a shell script, Linux, and security expert. 
Explain the function of the code.
Determine what file(s) the code is accessing and if the read, write, or execute permission required for the code to run.
Do treat the command itself as an accessed file. Commands like echo, ls, bash, python, etc. are considered files that need permission to execute.

Only list the file names, not the path to the file.

For example: `ls -l`, `echo "Hello, World!"`, and `cd /bin` do not need execute permission.
If read permission is required for the code, create an access statement:
"ACCESS STATEMENT: read: required, filename: (the file being accessed)"
or
If write permission is required for the code, create an access statement:
"ACCESS STATEMENT: write: required, filename: (the file being accessed)"
or
If execute permission is required for the code, create an access statement:
"ACCESS STATEMENT: execute: required, filename: (the file being accessed)"
or
If no permission is required
"ACCESS STATEMENT: permission: not required, filename: (the file being accessed)"

Analyze the following sh code snippet:
